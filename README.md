## 📘 Overview

RGCC-X⁺ is a control-theoretic middleware framework that models hallucination in large language models (LLMs) as a stochastic dynamical state and applies:

- Contractive feedback control  
- Kalman latent state estimation  
- Risk-gated adaptive contraction  
- Lyapunov stability certification  
- Information-theoretic lower bounds  

The framework provides **formal guarantees of bounded hallucination dynamics under stated assumptions**, rather than relying purely on empirical mitigation.

## 🧠 Core Mathematical Model

Hallucination state evolution:

e_{t+1} = (1 - eta) e_t + epsilon + xi_t

where:

- eta ∈ (0,1] → contraction strength  
- epsilon → entropy-imposed irreducible floor  
- xi_t → stochastic disturbance  

Steady state:

e* = epsilon / eta

Epistemic Reliability Equation:

e* = c * H(Y|X) / eta

This formalizes the trade-off between conditional entropy and control strength.

## 📐 Theoretical Guarantees

The framework proves:

1. Uniform Ultimate Boundedness  
2. Drift Suppression  
3. Switching Stability  
4. Adversarial Damping  
5. Entropy-Imposed Lower Bound  

All proofs are detailed in the manuscript.

## 🔬 Synthetic Validation

Monte Carlo simulation (300 steps, 50 seeds):

| Condition | Steady-State | Variance @ t=300 |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Uncontrolled | No convergence | 0.120 |
| Static (eta=0.4) | 0.050 | 0.00063 |
| Adaptive RGCC-X⁺ | 0.038 | 0.00048 |

All results match theoretical predictions within <5% error.

## 📊 Preliminary Empirical Evidence (TruthfulQA Subset)

| Method | Hallucination Rate | Latency |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| Baseline | 28% | 1.0x |
| Static | 21% | 1.8x |
| Adaptive RGCC-X⁺ | 16% | 1.4x |

These are preliminary directional results. Large-scale validation is future work.
